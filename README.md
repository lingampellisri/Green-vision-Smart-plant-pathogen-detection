## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User Uploads Leaf Image** 📷  
   → OpenCV preprocesses the image  
2. **Model Predicts Disease** 🧠  
   → TensorFlow CNN model returns class  
3. **Result is Shown** 🎯  
   → Flask renders output on UI with confidence level

## 🌱 Dataset

Used publicly available plant leaf datasets (e.g., PlantVillage) for training. Preprocessing included:

* Image resizing (224x224)
* Normalization
* Noise filtering (Gaussian blur)
* Augmentation (rotation, flip, etc.)

---

## 📊 Model Details

* Architecture: 4 Conv Layers + MaxPooling + Dense Layers
* Accuracy: \~96% on test data
* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

---

## 🔐 Authentication Module

* User registration and login
* Passwords are hashed and securely stored
* User history tracking (optional feature)

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* 🌍 Multi-language support
* 📲 Mobile App (React Native or Flutter)
* ☁️ Cloud-based model deployment with GPU
* 🧬 Expandable disease database
* 🛰️ Integrate with IoT-based leaf scanner

Let me know if you want this README to include:
- A `.env` guide for MongoDB connection.
- Deployment steps (e.g., using Heroku or Docker).
- Swagger API documentation for the backend.

Would you like me to generate this in a downloadable file or as code blocks for GitHub directly?
